20/12/24, 4:59 pm - +91 94403 43273: Dear Students,

I would like to share an observation based on my experience. Unlike other institutions, our campus is fortunate to attract companies for recruitment. However, at many other institutions, companies are not visiting or making selections.

Despite this challenging landscape, our campus is actively working to bring companies to our campus. Unfortunately, we have noticed that many of our students are not registering for these opportunities or attending the subsequent selection processes.

I strongly encourage all of you to take advantage of these opportunities. Your active participation and engagement are crucial in making the most of these recruitment drives.

Please respond and attend positively to these opportunities.

Best regards,
Prof Obbu Chandra Sekhar

28/02/25, 8:52 am - +91 96258 96327: Assessment Do’s & Don’ts :

 

✅ Do’s:
✔ Ensure you are in a quiet, well-lit space with minimal distractions.
✔ Check your camera, microphone, and internet connection before starting.
✔ Wear professional, neat clothing and maintain a proper posture.
✔ Stay focused and avoid looking away from the screen unnecessarily.

✔Close all unnecessary tabs and mute notifications before starting the test.
✔ If you face any technical issues, contact +91-8755683371 or use the “Contact Us” button on the screen.
✔ The test supports both Hindi & English as it is a dialogue-based assessment tool.
✔ The test is time-bound and must be completed in one sitting but in case due to any unforeseen circumstances- technical glitch or any other due to which the test stops midway , student can re-log with the same credentials and the test will begin again where he/she had last left.

 

🚫 Don’ts:
❌ Do not open or switch any other tabs, apps, or browse the internet for help.Switching /browsing tabs will be considered a proctoring violation & will result in disqualification.
❌ Do not talk to anyone off-camera or seek assistance from others as the tool captures voice.
❌ Do not make excessive movements or manipulate the video feed.
❌ Do not refresh, as it may lead to automatic submission.
❌ The test is strictly individual-based—collaboration or assistance is prohibited.
